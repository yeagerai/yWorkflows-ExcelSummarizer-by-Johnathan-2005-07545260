# Component Name

ExcelDataExtractor

# Description

The ExcelDataExtractor component is designed to extract data from Excel workbooks and process it according to specific business rules. Its primary function is to read data from an input workbook, process and analyze the data, and return the results in a structured format.

# Input and Output Models

## Input

The input model for this component is the `ExcelDataExtractorInputDict` class, which contains the following field:

- `input_workbook` (str): The path to the input Excel workbook file that needs to be processed by the component.

## Output

The output model for this component is the `ExcelDataExtractorOutputDict` class, which contains the following field:

- `results` (dict): The processed data returned as a dictionary, where the key is the sheet name and the value is a list of row data.

# Parameters

The component's constructor takes no parameters but reads the following configuration values from the component's YAML file:

- `api_key` (Optional[str]): The API key for connecting to the Excel API or other data source (if applicable). The key is fetched from an environment variable that's been set using the `dotenv` library.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method takes an `ExcelDataExtractorInputDict` object as input and returns an `ExcelDataExtractorOutputDict` object as output. The method performs the following steps:

1. Read the input Excel workbook using the `openpyxl` library.
2. Connect to the Excel API or other data source using the provided API key (if applicable) and analyze the data. This step is a placeholder for the actual data source and processing logic.
3. Iterate through each sheet in the workbook and extract row data as a list of lists.
4. Compile the extracted data into a dictionary, where the key is the sheet name and the value is the list of row data.
5. Return the results as an `ExcelDataExtractorOutputDict` object.

# External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external libraries:

- `openpyxl`: A Python library for reading and writing Excel files.
- `fastapi`: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- `pydantic`: A library for data validation and parsing using Python type annotations.
- `dotenv`: A Python library for loading environment variables from .env files.
- `os`: A standard Python library for interacting with the operating system.
- `yaml`: A YAML parser and emitter for Python.

# API Calls

This component includes a placeholder for connecting to the Excel API or other data sources. The actual API call and usage will depend on the specific data source and analysis requirements.

# Error Handling

This component does not specifically handle errors but relies on the inherent error handling features of the external libraries and FastAPI framework. Users of the component should be prepared to handle potential exceptions such as file not found, incorrect schema, and other data validation or processing errors.

# Examples

Below is an example of using the ExcelDataExtractor component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Configure the component's YAML file to include the `api_key` parameter:
