# Component Name

ExcelSummarizer

# Description

The ExcelSummarizer component is a building block in the Yeager Workflow designed to process an input Excel file and return a summarized output as a Word file.

# Input and Output Models

- **ExcelInputModel:** This is the input data model for the component, which represents the expected input data structure. It consists of a single attribute `file`, which is of type `bytes` and represents the contents of the input Excel file.

- **WordOutputModel:** This is the output data model for the component, representing the returned data structure. It consists of a single attribute `file`, which is of type `bytes` and represents the contents of the generated Word file.

# Parameters

The ExcelSummarizer component has the following parameters:

- **args:** (type: ExcelInputModel) The input data to be processed by the component, in the form of an ExcelInputModel instance.
- **callbacks:** (type: typing.Any) The callbacks to be used during the execution of the component. In this case, no default value is provided, and the parameter is not used within the component's implementation.

# Transform Function

The transform() method of the ExcelSummarizer component processes the input data and outputs a WordOutputModel instance. It performs the following steps:

1. Call the `super().transform()` method, passing in the `args` and `callbacks` parameters. This will execute the abstract implementation of the transform method from the AbstractWorkflow base class.
2. Extract the relevant output from the `results_dict` by access the 'your_key' value, which contains the summarized information usable for the Word output.
3. Instantiate a new WordOutputModel instance, passing the `word_output` as the `file` attribute.
4. Return the WordOutputModel instance.

# External Dependencies

The ExcelSummarizer component uses the following external libraries:

- **dotenv:** Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- **fastapi:** Used for creating the FastAPI application that exposes the transform() method as an asynchronous HTTP POST endpoint.
- **pydantic:** Used for defining and validating the input and output models (ExcelInputModel and WordOutputModel).

# API Calls

This component does not make any external API calls.

# Error Handling

The component inherits error handling from the AbstractWorkflow base class.

# Examples

To use the ExcelSummarizer component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an ExcelInputModel with the contents of the input Excel file.
2. Call the component's `transform()` method with the instantiated ExcelInputModel.
3. Process the resulting WordOutputModel to access the summarized Word file contents.
