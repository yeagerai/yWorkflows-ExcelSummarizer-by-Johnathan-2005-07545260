# Component Name
FormulaAnalyzer

# Description
The `FormulaAnalyzer` component is designed to analyze formulas in an Excel workbook and generate a formula report identifying issues and optimization opportunities for each formula. This component can process input data and return output data in different formats, such as text or PDF.

# Input and Output Models
## Input Model: `FormulaAnalyzerInputDict`
The input model is a Pydantic `BaseModel` containing the following field:
- `input_workbook` (bytes): This field contains the binary content of the input Excel workbook.

## Output Model: `FormulaAnalyzerOutputDict`
The output model is a Pydantic `BaseModel` containing the following field:
- `formula_report` (str): This field contains the final formula report in the specified format.

# Parameters
The component contains the following parameters:
- `report_format` (Optional[str]): This parameter specifies the output format of the formula report. Accepted values are "pdf" or "txt". Default value is determined by the component configuration file.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method of the `FormulaAnalyzer` component performs the following steps:

1. Save the input workbook as a temporary file.
2. Load the workbook using the `openpyxl` library.
3. Initialize an empty string for the `formula_report`.
4. Iterate through each worksheet and cell in the workbook.
   - If the cell contains a formula, extract the formula.
   - Analyze the formula, identifying and breaking down its components. (Placeholder implementation only)
   - Identify issues or optimization opportunities. (Placeholder implementation only)
   - Generate a report entry for the cell, including its coordinate, formula, analyzed formula, and issues/suggestions.
   - Append the entry to the `formula_report`.
5. Convert the report to the specified output format (PDF or TXT). (Placeholder implementation only)
6. Return the final `FormulaAnalyzerOutputDict` object containing the `formula_report`.

# External Dependencies
The `FormulaAnalyzer` component depends on the following external libraries:

1. `openpyxl`: Provides functionality for reading and analyzing Excel workbooks.
2. `pydantic`: Enables creation of input and output models for data validation and serialization.
3. `fastapi`: Provides fast, asynchronous web APIs.
4. `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
5. `yaml`: Parses a configuration file in YAML format.

# API Calls
Currently, no external API calls are made by the `FormulaAnalyzer` component.

# Error Handling
The `FormulaAnalyzer` component relies on the built-in Python error handling for exceptions and error messages. Placeholder implementations for analyzing and identifying issues/suggestions will be replaced by proper error handling in the future.
